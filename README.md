# Py_FireGuard
This is a stateful packet inspection firewall created with python. A stateful inspection firewall is a security system that doesn't just examine packets, but monitors the entirety of connections made within a network. This ensures only permitted traffic passes through a network. This specific python project utilizes the scapy module to capture live network traffic. It also includes rule based filtering and TCP connection tracking. A strong network security system is vital to protecting a company's confidentiality, integrity, and avaliablity of their data. The average time to detect a security breach from threat actors is around 6 months and even longer. That is why it is imperative that network traffic is constantly monitored for suspicious activity and other potential anomalies. There are so many aspects that must be covered that also makes this project so modular as it can always be improved. Everyone should feel free to leave any suggestions or comments!
